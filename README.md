# qnetload
Note that this early stages of work in progress.

I still (2017) use xnetload and I think that the way that shows the information is extremely useful. Sadly xnetload was removed from Debian in 2010:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=595195

I've evaluated many similar packages but I wasn't satifised with any of them, so if time permits I'll write a very similar xnetload using Qt (so I named it qnetload).
